        <p style="font-family: 'Oswald'">Kubernetes (commonly stylized as k8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
            It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform
            or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.</p>
